The deck code generator is pulled from Riot Games public repository. The TypeScript implementation of this encoder is provided by maintainer icepeng https://github.com/RiotGames/LoRDeckCodes https://github.com/icepeng/lor-deckcode

CHANGES:
Replacing jQuery and Vega Lite is the use of Angular components. jQuery was omitted as the npm libraries for it conflicted with the TypeScript implementation of the various Angular components. Vega Lite was foregone as other third-party deck building tools have such features; it also goes against the Stacked Deck's design philosophy of randomness and luck to include such breakdowns.
